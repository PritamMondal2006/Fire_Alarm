This repository contains our first hackathon project, a Fire Alarm System aimed at early detection of fire or smoke to improve safety in homes and small buildings. The system uses sensors to continuously monitor environmental conditions and triggers an alarm when a critical threshold is reached, providing quick alerts for timely action. Through this project, our team gained hands-on experience in IoT basics, sensor integration, frontend–backend coordination, and teamwork under time constraints, making it a strong learning-focused and beginner-friendly hackathon solution.
